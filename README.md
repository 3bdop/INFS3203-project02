# Pet Adoption Application Project Plan

Our project aims to create a mobile application for pet adoption and placement for adoption, aligning with Qatar's National Development Strategy (NDS) goals to improve the quality of life. This is achieved by recognizing the significant impact pets have on physical and mental health. The application positions itself not just as a pet adoption platform but as a component of a comprehensive wellness strategy.

## Possible Effects

- **Reduction in Homeless Pets:** By facilitating easier pet adoptions, the app aims to decrease the number of animals in shelters.
- **Economic Relief:** Reducing the number of homeless pets can lessen the economic burden on local governments and NGOs.
- **Community Engagement:** The app encourages community participation in pet adoption, fostering a sense of responsibility and engagement with local issues.

## Functional Features

- **Add Pet for adoption:** Enables registered breeders and pet owners to list pets for adoption with detailed profiles, including health, breed, and care information.
- **Adopt a Pet:** Users can browse pets available for adoption, using filters like location, breed, size, etc., to find the right match.
- **Save a Pet as Favorite:** Allows users to save pet profiles to their favorites for easy access later, aiding the decision-making process.

## Preliminary Prototype Requirements

- **Home Page:** Features pets for adoption and a quick search bar.
- **Pet Profiles:** Detailed pages for each pet, including photos, health information, and adoption details.
- **Favorites:** A section for users to review their saved pets.
- **User Registration:** A straightforward sign-up process for adopters, and those looking to list a pet.
- **Search and Filter:** Enables users to search for pets by various criteria.
