# Testing Challenges in React Native App Development

We encountered many challenges in implementing testing for our React Native app, mainly due to compatibility issues between Jest and the ES6 syntax used in React Native. Jest operates with ES5, leading to an incompatibility where ES6 import statements are not recognized, causing our tests to fail. Attempts to adjust the Jest configuration, based on online recommendations, by adding libraries using import statements to the transformIgnorePatterns in the jest configuraiton file in order to ignore these during transformation, were unsuccessful. Jest still failed to recognize import commands, indicating unresolved ES6 syntax compatibility issues. Additionally, exploring Detox for end-to-end testing and attempting to mock the database for isolated testing faced similar challenges, mainly due to Jest's dependency and configuration file errors. For the above reasonse we could not impement the testing for our app.
